## Motivation
As a student balancing intensive academic work and personal projects, I often struggled with staying focused despite using traditional productivity tools. Many tools either focused solely on blocking distractions or tracking time, but didn't address the full workflow of intentional work. 

I built FocusLock to solve this problem by creating a system that encourages:
- Setting a clear task before starting
- Eliminating distractions during work
- Reflecting on what was accomplished afterward

By combining these elements, FocusLock transforms productivity from simply "spending time" into actively making progress. This project reflects my interest in building tools that are not only functional, but also aligned with how people actually work and stay accountable.
